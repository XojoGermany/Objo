# Objo

Objo is an object-oriented dynamically typed BASIC-like programming language. It borrows the familiar syntax of Xojo and Visual Basic but by virtue of being dynamically typed it does away with a lot boilerplate code and allows techniques such as duck-typing. It can be ahead of time compiled for easy distribution and is executed in a stack-based virtual machine.

Objo is designed to be either run from the command line or easily embedded into a Xojo application as a replacement for Xojoscript.

This language is being developed to help teach how programming languages work. You can follow its implementation on my [YouTube channel][YouTubeChannel] or through [my website](https://garrypettet.com).
