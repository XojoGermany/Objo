# Objo

Objo is an object-oriented dynamically typed BASIC-like programming language. It borrows the familiar syntax of Xojo and Visual Basic but by virtue of being dynamically typed it does away with a lot boilerplate code and allows techniques such as duck-typing. It can be ahead of time compiled for easy distribution and is executed in a stack-based virtual machine.
